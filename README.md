# Introduction

The Internet is a decentralized system for sharing information of all types, but unfortunately most social information (namely, identity information intended for social consumption and related content published by individuals) is concentrated within the centralized servers of very few corporations, making it undesirably difficult for individuals to reliably and efficiently access, transfer and preserve much of the information they post online. Additionally, the centralization of this personal information restricts the myriad ways in which people could otherwise use it to publish and communicate, leaving the development of new functionality that leverages this information to these few corporations and their particular profit motives.

Nashville is a system intended to help individuals achieve more control and functionality with the information they've historically handed over to these corporations while *not* requiring these same individuals to divorce themselves from the centralized status quo, since that would impose an unreasonably costly requirement. It does so by leveraging the emergence of cloud synchronization solutions such as Dropbox and iCloud to copy the information that individuals post to centralized social networks over to their own cloud storage accounts and devices and simultaneously provide a platform for applications to use these individually owned copies as their data sources.

This has the immediate benefit of ensuring close ownership of social information by individuals rather than just centralized hosts, enabling local file access to this information and safeguarding against future changes to those hosts that may jeopardize access even further. The concomitant decentralized hosting of this same information via the APIs of the individuals' cloud storage solutions also enables any number of services to be built that improve the ways in which these individuals share their information and communicate online, such as to publish social information on their own domains and independently maintain their own online profiles. These independent hosts can be used to power isolated websites and similar publishing points, or they can be used by applications that use various individuals' data to produce rich social experiences.
