# Asheville

Asheville is a system for owning one's online identity, content and associations.

## Questions

This topic has been discussed before – how do we begin to take control
of our online identity? These questions present common criticsms
of projects like Asheville, followed by answers to how we will attempt
to circumvent these problems.

### How do you get normal people to use it?

### Haven't a lot of smart people tried this?

### Won't you just be another centralized social network?

### Isn't Dropbox, Box.net, etc. just as centralized?

### How secure is it?

### Who owns it? Will the data be sold?

### Who is going to pay for the servers to run the system?


## Organization

Asheville operates like an open source software project. There is an
attempt to have no central authority or managing body, but rather
contributors working collaboratively alongside the community.

Anyone can participate in everything from the product planning meetings
to code reviews and feature discussions.

In order to facilate this collaboration, Asheville uses GitHub both
to share code as well as ideas and discussion. Sometimes, human interaction
is needed – in that case public Google Hangouts are held that anyone
can attend and participate in.

### Meetings



### Cost

Initially, core contributors will share cost if they desire on an equal
basis. This includes initial marketing costs (i.e domain registration)
as well as server costs.

### Account Security

Accounts on systems like infrastructure providers will need to be kept
private, of course. In this case, credentials and emails are shared
among core contributors to prevent siloing access, while still
upholding security.

### Liability

TODO. There are liability concerns with running servers and accepting
minimal user data (such as Dropbox tokens, in this case). Some entity
will need to be liable for this.
