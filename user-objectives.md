# User Objectives
This document outlines a core set of user objectives that Asheville aims to support with its web app. Each objective is not meant to denote a particular user interface (such as a page or form) per se but rather a goal that any given user would be able to achieve by using the web app.

These objectives can be used on a high level to map out both technical specifications and more detailed design requirements.
