# User Objectives

This document outlines a core set of user objectives that Asheville aims to support with its web app. Each objective is not meant to denote a particular user interface (such as a page or form) per se but rather a goal that any given user would be able to achieve by using the web app, and these goals can each be satisfied by one or more interfaces as needed.

These objectives can be used on a high level to map out both technical specifications and more detailed design requirements.
